**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

**Understanding Credit Card fraud**

Credit card fraud is any dishonest act and behaviour to obtain information without the proper authorization from the account holder for financial gain. 

Below are different ways of fraud associated with Credit Card :

- Skimming : Duplicating information located on the magnetic strip of the card.
- Manipulation/alteration of genuine cards
- Misuse of stolen/lost credit cards
- Creation of counterfeit cards
- Fraudulent tele-marketing

**Problem Statement**

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. 

**Business Problem Overview**

In Banking and FinTech industry, retaining profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal. Any sort of substantial financial loss consequent to a fraud is a concern for both banks/organisations and customers. This not only impact trust & credibility but also jeopardizes customer loyalty and deteriorates the bank-customer relationship.

It has been estimated by Nilson report that by 2020 the banking frauds would account to $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing with new and different ways.

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not just a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.

**Getting Started**

We have created a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. Model evaluation is done as per the accuracy score on both train & test data. For this project, we have used the Logistic Regression model. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.
